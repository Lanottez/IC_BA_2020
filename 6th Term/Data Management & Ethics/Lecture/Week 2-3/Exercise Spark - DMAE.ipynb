    "#  This exercise will demonstrate how easy it is to perform web server log analysis with Apache Spark.\n",
    " \n",
    "Server log analysis is an ideal use case for Spark.  It's a very large, common data source and contains a rich set of information.  Spark allows you to store your logs in files on disk cheaply, while still providing a quick and simple way to perform data analysis on them.  This homework will show you how to use Apache Spark on real-world text-based production logs and fully harness the power of that data.  Log data comes from many sources, such as web, file, and compute servers, application logs, user-generated content,  and can be used for monitoring servers, improving business and customer intelligence, building recommendation systems, fraud detection, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to complete this exercise\n",
    " \n",
    "This exercise is broken up into sections with bite-sized examples for demonstrating Spark functionality for log processing. For each problem, you should start by thinking about the algorithm that you will use to *efficiently* process the log in a parallel, distributed manner. This means using the various [RDD](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.RDD.html) operations along with [`lambda` functions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#lambda-expressions) that are applied at each worker.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Part 1: Apache Web Server Log file format\n",
    "The log files that we use for this exercise are in the [Apache Common Log Format (CLF)](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/logs.html#common). The log file entries produced in CLF will look something like this:\n",
    "`127.0.0.1 - - [01/Aug/1995:00:00:01 -0400] \"GET /images/launch-logo.gif HTTP/1.0\" 200 1839`\n",
    " \n",
    "* `-`\n",
    "The \"hyphen\" in the output indicates that the requested piece of information (user identity from remote machine) is not available.\n",
    " \n",
    "* `-`\n",
    "The \"hyphen\" in the output indicates that the requested piece of information (user identity from local logon) is not available.\n",
    " \n",
    "* `[01/Aug/1995:00:00:01 -0400]`\n",
    "The time that the server finished processing the request. The format is:\n",
    "`[day/month/year:hour:minute:second timezone]`\n",
    "  * day = 2 digits\n",

    " \n",
    "* `\"GET /images/launch-logo.gif HTTP/1.0\"`\n",
    "####This is the first line of the request string from the client. It consists of a three components: the request method (e.g., `GET`, `POST`, etc.), the endpoint (a [Uniform Resource Identifier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_identifier)), and the client protocol version.\n",
    " \n",
    "* `200`\n",
    "This is the status code that the server sends back to the client. This information is very valuable, because it reveals whether the request resulted in a successful response (codes beginning in 2), a redirection (codes beginning in 3), an error caused by the client (codes beginning in 4), or an error in the server (codes beginning in 5). The full list of possible status codes can be found in the HTTP specification ([RFC 2616](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt) section 10).\n",
    " \n",
    "* `1839`\n",
    "The last entry indicates the size of the object returned to the client, not including the response headers. If no content was returned to the client, this value will be \"-\" (or sometimes 0).\n",
    " \n",
    "** Note that log files contain information supplied directly by the client, without escaping. Therefore, it is possible for malicious clients to insert control-characters in the log files, *so care must be taken in dealing with raw logs.**\n",
