### Abstract (suggest 150 words)

COVID-19, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in late December 2019, but quickly spread to other countries[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0896-8#ref-CR1) in Asia, Europe and North America and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020 (ref. [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0896-8#ref-CR2)). There are now confirmed individuals with COVID-19 in nearly every country of the world, and the WHO has urged affected countries to slow the spread of the virus by imposing containment and suppression measures[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0896-8#ref-CR3),[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0896-8#ref-CR4) ranging from strict controls on travel, social gatherings and commercial activities aimed at ‘flattening the curve’ (that is, decreasing the rate of new infections to avoid overwhelming healthcare systems) to less strict measures designed to shield immunologically compromised individuals, treat victims and achieve ‘herd immunity’ (that is, a sufficiently large number of recovered and, therefore, immune individuals to prevent the effective spread of the virus)[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0896-8#ref-CR5). Differences in the strictness of such policies and the rapidity with which jurisdictions have imposed and relaxed the policies reflect divergent (and perhaps hasty) assessments of both the public health risk of COVID-19 and the social and economic impacts of the different policies[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0896-8#ref-CR6),[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0896-8#ref-CR7). Using a newly developed economic disaster model[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0896-8#ref-CR8),[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0896-8#ref-CR9),[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0896-8#ref-CR10), we quantitatively assess the short-run supply-chain effects of different containment strategies across countries and industry sectors to inform ongoing efforts to contain COVID-19 and to reveal more generally how pandemic-related economic losses will be distributed along global supply chains.

Details of our analytical approach are provided in the [Methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0896-8#Sec4). In summary, we modelled the short-term economic shocks of different COVID-19 response scenarios as sector-specific transportation and labour supply constraints. The model operates in weekly time steps using the latest available global input–output data[11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0896-8#ref-CR11) and taking into account interactions throughout complex global supply chains and the contexts of scarcity and imbalance that prevail in most markets[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0896-8#ref-CR9). Our enhanced adaptive regional input–output (ARIO) model incorporates substitutability of inputs and dynamic choices of supply-chain linkages (Supplementary Fig. [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0896-8#MOESM1)), which contribute to a more realistic representation of bottlenecks along global supply chains. By applying our model to the simulation of control policies during a pandemic, we can assess the potential impact of different policies on the supply chains and examine the externalities of control measures. Note that our model is distinct from computable general equilibrium (CGE) models in that it is specifically designed to assess economic impacts in response to disasters that unfold over weeks or months, before production structures and trade networks have time to adjust to new production patterns. Moreover, the goal of this study is not to predict the true cost of the COVID-19 pandemic, but to identify the most important aspects of disease control (such as strictness, duration and recurrence of lockdowns) and test the sensitivity of these factors as their impacts ripple through global supply chains, supported by several sets of scenarios for containment measures. Thus, in addition to showing how overall damages might change under different policy scenarios, the incidence of damages across sectors and countries may inform the allocation of international aid and economic stimulus.
