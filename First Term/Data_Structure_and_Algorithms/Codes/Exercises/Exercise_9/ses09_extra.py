# Dijkstra with a heap queue

import heapq as hq

def dijkstra_heap(graph,start):
    """
    Dijkstra's algorithm with a heap 
    
    Since we don't have a quick deletion from heap, we add everything to heap "lazily".
    That is, if we find a lower Dijkstra score than previously, we don't replace the old one.
    We just add the new one, which will have priority over the old one as the score is lower.
    
    This means the heap may contain the same node several times with different Dijkstra scores.
    This is not a problem for correctness since the heap is ordered by the score.
    But we need to stop the algorithm with the break command after we visit all nodes.
    
    Parameters:
        graph: a Graph (or Digraph) 
        start: starting node for the algorithm
    Returns: 
        dists: dictionary containing shortest distances to all nodes
        prev_nodes: dictionary containing the previous node from which each node was explored
                None for the starting node
    
    Examples:
    >>> graph = gs.Digraph(lecture_graph())
    >>> dists, prev_nodes = dijkstra_heap(graph, 'a')
    >>> [dists['b'], dists['e'], dists['c'], dists['d']]
    [1, 7, 3, 5]
    >>> [prev_nodes['a'], prev_nodes['e'], prev_nodes['c'], prev_nodes['d']]
