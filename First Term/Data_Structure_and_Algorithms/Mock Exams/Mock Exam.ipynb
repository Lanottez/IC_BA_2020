Now the gcd must also divide the difference of 44 and 20, which is 24, so we look for the gcd of 24 and 20. Again, the gcd must also divide the difference, so we find the gcd of 20 and 4. We repeat the procedure until we end up looking for the gcd of 4 and 4, which must be 4. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of 64 and 20 is 4. \n",
