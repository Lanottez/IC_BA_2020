    "\n",
    "So far we've been using the Python console and the Spyder IDE to write code. Now we'll introduce another convenient way to both write code and present it: the Jupyter Notebook. Briefly, the notebook is an interactive computing environment that allows us to include \"live\" Python code that the user can run, combined with explanations, narrative text, equations, etc. Notebooks can also easily be exported to html and PDF formats. Due to this flexibility, they have become popular in various contexts: for example, they are often used in analytics teams to share and present ideas. This document and all the other html files have been written as Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main visible component of the notebook is a web application, which is your interface with the notebook. It allows you to both create and manage documents and write and run Python code. All of this happens in your browser. The web application uses a process called Python kernel to run your code - essentially there is an IPython \"shell\" (resembling Spyder's console) running in the background. The documents have the extension `.ipynb`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook format is not limited to Python, but can be used with other languages including R, as long as the corresponding kernel has been installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook comes with your Anaconda distribution. You can find it in the Anaconda Navigator. In Windows, you should also be able to find it by tapping the Windows key and starting to type Jupyter. Opening the program starts both a log window (a command line/terminal that documents what goes on in the Python kernel) and a new tab in your web browser. \n",
    "\n",
    "When Jupyter Notebook starts, the browser window shows a folder view, by default of the directory `C:\\Users\\USERNAME` in Windows, and similarly your user folder in macOS. Navigate to the directory where you saved the session files in the Jupyter browser window, and open the file `trump_tweets.ipynb`. If you saved your files somewhere else (say on D: drive), please copy and paste them to within the directory where Jupyter opens. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Advanced**. It is possible to change the default of Jupyter Notebook to any directory, but the process a bit technical so we won't go into the details here."

The dataset we used ended in summer 2016. What if we wanted to analyse more recent tweets?
