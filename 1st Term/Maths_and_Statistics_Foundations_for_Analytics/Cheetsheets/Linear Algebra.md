### Subspace

* A nonempty subset $\mathbb{V}$ of  $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a subspace of  $\mathbb{R}^n$ if, for any scalars $\alpha,\beta$

* Subspace Test:  To tell if $\mathbb{S}$ is a subspace of some vector space $\mathbb{R}^n$ you must check two things: 
  * if $s_1$ and $s_2$ are vectors in $\mathbb{S}$, their sum $s_1$ + $s_2$ must also be in S
  * if is a vector in S and c is a scalar,then cs should also be in S.
