## Instruction

* Complete this RMarkdown file and "Knit" the HTML output (saved as **Lecture_8_YOUR_CID_NUMBER.html**) and upload to the Hub before the deadline.
* Change the author property in the YAML header above to your CID number. 

* For this exercise, we will use `flights` dataset from `nycflights13` package. Install the `nycflights13` if you have not installed yet. This is a dataset of all flights that departed NYC (JFK, LGA or EWR) in 2013. 
* To complete this exercise, make sure you have installed the tidyverse package. `install.packages("tidyverse")`

### Filtering

Find the number of flights that:
```{r eval = F}
# Had an arrival delay of two or more hours
# [1] 10200
nrow(filter(flights,arr_delay>=120))
# Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)
# [1] 9313
nrow(filter(flights,dest %in% c('IAH','HOU')))
# Were operated by United, American, or Delta
# [1] 139504
nrow(filter(flights,carrier %in% c('AA','UA','DL')))
# Departed in summer (July, August, and September) and have missing departure time values
# [1] 1878
nrow(filter(flights,is.na(dep_time) & month %in% c(7,8,9)))
# Arrived more than two hours late, but didnâ€™t leave late
# [1] 29
nrow(filter(flights,arr_delay>120 & dep_delay<=0))
# Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
# [1] 2074
nrow(filter(flights,dep_delay>=60 & arr_delay<=(dep_delay-30)))
```
## Sorting
List the first 3 rows of the resulting dataframe. The outputs shown here only list the first 9 columns and may not show the column that was sorted on.

## Grouped summaries

```{r eval = F}

# Which carrier had the largest mean departure delay?  Smallest?
# F9       20.2
# US       3.78
flights %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarise(mean_delay = mean(dep_delay,na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(mean_delay) %>%
  {. ->> flight_data}
tail(flight_data,1)
head(flight_data,1)


# Which carrier had the largest difference between their max and min departure delay?
#   carrier   max   min delta
#   <chr>   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
# 1 HA       1301   -16  1317
flights %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarise(max =  max(dep_delay), min = min(dep_delay), delta = (max(dep_delay,na.rm=TRUE) -  min(dep_delay,na.rm=TRUE)) ) %>%
  arrange(desc(delta)) %>%
  head(1)

# Which month has the largest variance for arrival delays? (use standard deviation)
# July
flights %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(variance =  sd(arr_delay,na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(variance)) %>%
  {. ->> variance_data}
variance_data[1,1]


```

## Pipe

Using the pipe operator follow these steps with the flight data:

* filter out missing values that exist in the tail number and arrival delay variables
* group the data by tail number
* calculate the average arrival delay and the number of observations by tail number
* plot average arrival delay vs. number of observations

```{r}
# Your code
flights %>%
  filter(!is.na(tailnum),!is.na(arr_delay)) %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  summarise(ave_arr_delay =  mean(arr_delay,na.rm = TRUE),n=n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ave_arr_delay, y = n)) + geom_point()
```


Using the pipe operator follow these steps with the flight data:

* group by month and carrier
* compute the average arrival delay
* plot a line chart with month on the x-axis, average delay on the y-axis
* colour-code each line by carrier or try faceting by carrier

```{r}
# Your code
flights %>%
  group_by(month,carrier) %>%
  summarise(ave_arr_delay =  mean(arr_delay,na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x = month, y = ave_arr_delay,colour=carrier)) + geom_line()
```
