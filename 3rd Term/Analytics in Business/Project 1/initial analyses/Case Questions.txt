Case Questions


1. How could they improve their pricing strategy
Mention the duration of different segments and discuss if there is a specific target group
Different pricing for different clubs or different segments e.g. students/retiree etc
Price discrimination: the price for different clubs should be flexible, depending on the change of customers social class and the peak/offpeak preference over years 


2. What happened when the price was increased
Churn increase, how the revenue affected include those plots and include the analysis in Appendix
How the price increase afffect different segments  e.g effect on growth rate of new memberships by segments 

3. What does this suggest as possible options going forward
Except for adjustment in pricing maybe adaprt a new model , combining specialised services on a budget to reduce churn etc?
Maybe some clubs are not so profitable??
try to reduce churn rate, by giving better deal for people stay more than 12 months, by holding more group exercise, try to target better member to join -- can this link with our segment analysis?

4. In additional to price, what other factors influence whether a member is going to leave
Gym environment (Visitins hours - peak times etc)? age of the club? 
Location, which also affect increase in new membership - there is membership boots when new gym ope

5. Bonus: Given this, to what degree can we predict individual n-pea
Using KNN model to predict the duration of customers based on the provided information. The accuracy rate is about 30%

## Report Structure (based on guidelines)

### Title pagr

### Summary

###Introduction

An overview of the context for the analysis, including a clear statement of the business problem -> plot the revenue over time and state the not so big growth 
Clear statement of your hypotheses and predictions
* churn has played a big role in the phenomenon of not high enough revenue growth, plot churn over time
* churn affected differently different customers segments
A brief overview of the approach used in your analysis. -> Identify our customers profile (include summary graphs for customer profile), how the price increase affect the different segments and what trategies should we follow

### Technologies and techniques ???
An exact process description used in the analysis
Sufficient detail of the data analysis for someone to replicate the results (this should
be automatic in Jupyter Notebook).

###Results
A presentation and summary of the data using means, histograms and other descriptive statistics
Figures, tables and graphs, insofar as they help to enhance the clarity of the  information (include captions)
An explanation of any figures, tables or graphs

### Discussion
A short paragraph summarising the overall trend of the findings
A clear statement of whether your hypothesis is correct (include caveats where necessary) -> indeed the chur was incresed on 2016, affected differently tdifferent segments refert to those
An explanation of any errors
A discussion of the strengths and limitations of the analysis. -> e.g on question 5, or on further segmentation, as well as statistical analysis e.g regression etc
In the discussion , also discuss the underlying trends that may affect other factors e.g the increasing revenue may be influenced by the increase in the number of Clubs
