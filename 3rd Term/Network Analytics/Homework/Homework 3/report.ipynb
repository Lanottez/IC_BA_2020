    "Girvan-Newman is a top-down algorithm, which detects communities by progressively removing edges from the original network. This argorithm is based on a fact that in a network, the number of shortest paths through edges within communities is relatively small, and the number of shortest paths through edges between communities is relatively larger. It first calculates the betweenness of each edge, then removes the edge(s) with the highest betweenness. The Girvan-Newman algorithm repeats this step until each node is in its own community. \n",

    "On the other hand, the Louvain is a bottom-up algorithm, which is consisted of two steps. Firstly, the algorithm places each node in its own community. For each node, the algorithm calculates the modularity gains obtained by moving the node into each one of its neighborsâ€™ communities. Then, each node is moved to the community which maximize the modularity gains. If no gain is possible then the node stays in its original community. For the first step, the Louvain algorithm applies this procedure repeatedly, until no further improvement is possible. Then, the Louvain algorithm compress all nodes in the same community into a new node, and the weight of edges between nodes in the community is transformed into the weight of the ring of the new node, and the weight of edges between communities is transformed into the weight of edges between new nodes. \n",
    "For the second step, the algorithm builds a new network based on the communities detected by the first step. The inter- and intra-community links are represented in the new network by weighted regular links and self-loops, respectively.

    "For the karate dataset, while the two algorithms detect different communities, they present similar patterns. There are two major communities within the karate dataset, which in total consist of more than 2/3 of all nodes, and the rest nodes form other communities. In communities detected by Girvan Newman algorithm, the rest nodes form three communities, of which one community only contain one node. In communities detected by Louvain algorithm, the rest node form two communities. Moreover, the communities detected by the two algorithms have a similar modularity, which proves that the two algorithm return a similar division of communitiies. In the two major communities detected by both algorithms, there exist an obvious central node: in one community, node 0 is the most significant one; in the other community, node 21 and 23 are the most significant ones. The pattern observed from both algorithms matches the known ground-truth that in the club there is an administrator and an instructor who led to the split of the club into two. "

    "Unlike the karate dataset, for which the both the two algorithm detects two major communities, the email dataset shows different patterns.While using the Girvan Newman algorithm to detect the communities in the email dataset, the modularity is maximised when there are 8 communities, but 5 of them only contain single node. While using the Louvain algorithm to detect the communities, the modularity is maximised when there are 3 communities. Both algorithm, however, shows the similar patterns that there are two major communities in the email dataset. Moreover, it appears that the connection between communities in the email dataset are less dense comparing to the communities in the karate club dataset, as the for the karate dataset, the communities detected by the Girvan Newman algorithm and Louvain return modularity of 0.401 and 0.405, respectively, but for the email dataset, the communities detected by the Girvan Newman algorithm and Louvain return modularity of 0.201 and 0.279, respectively. This pattern make senses, since unlike the karata club, where the nodes are split by the administrator and instructor, the connection between communities of email dataset, which implies the email connection between students, are more dense.
